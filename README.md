 this is simple tictactoe browser game. Though there is nothing special about this, I like how I disabled the click once player won. It has a message also to determined who wons the game.
 Background image are digital handdrawn by me. And thanks to google font, its free.

 I hope you like it, just much as I do! 

 BTW, this is my first browser game, my first in my portfolio... So I decided to make the ReadMe informal. I promised, I do the proper ReadMe with my first project (my second browser game).
 Thank you. and Bless you!
